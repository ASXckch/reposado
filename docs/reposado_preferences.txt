Reposado's configuration is defined in a plist file named "preferences.plist" located in the same directory as the repoutil script.

Two key/values are required:

UpdatesRootDir: a string providing a path where the catalogs and update packages should be stored. Example: /Volumes/data/reposado/html

UpdatesMetadataDir: a string providing a path where metadata used by reposado should be should be stored. Example: /Volumes/data/reposado/metadata

If you are replicating the updates as well as the catalogs, you must also include:

LocalCatalogURLBase
	This is the "root" URL for your local Software Update repo. Reposado will re-write all product URLs in the update catalogs to use this root URL. For example, a LocalCatalogURLBase of "http://su.myorg.com" will result in a Snow Leopard update catalog URLs like:

http://su.myorg.com/content/catalogs/others/index-leopard-snowleopard.merged-1.sucatalog

If LocalCatalogURLBase is undefined, only Apple catalogs will be replicated and the URLs will not be re-written. This allows you to have custom catalogs for Apple Software Update, but clients will still download the actual update packages from Apple's servers. If Reposado is configured this way, you will not be able to offer deprecated updates to clients.

repoutil --config will allow you to quickly and easily edit the above three values (UpdatesRootDir, UpdatesMetadataDir, LocalCatalogURLBase).

Optional keys:

AppleCatalogURLs
	This is an array of strings that specify the Apple SUS catalog URLs to replicate. If this is undefined, it defaults to:

['http://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/index.sucatalog',
 'http://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog',
 'http://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-leopard-snowleopard.merged-1.sucatalog']

PreferredLocalizations
	A list of preferred language localizations for software update descriptions. Defaults to ['English', 'en'].
	
CurlPath
 	Path to the curl binary tool. Defaults to '/usr/bin/curl'
