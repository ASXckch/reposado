### Preferred contribution methods
#### Bug fixes
Bug fixes should be submitted as Pull Requests. 

#### Enhancements/New features
Before starting work on a new feature or enhancement, consider bringing your idea up for discussion on the [reposado mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/reposado). This might save you a lot of wasted effort. Once you have code for a new feature complete, push it to your own GitHub clone. You can then ask others to test it first, or proceed directly to creating a Pull Request.
